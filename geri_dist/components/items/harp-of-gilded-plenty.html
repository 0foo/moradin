            <li>Whenever you attempt to attune to the harp, you must first make either a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check or a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince the harp that you are worthy, attuning to the harp on a success. If you fail, you can't attempt to attune to the harp again until the next dawn. Once you have successfully attuned to the harp, the harp resizes to suit you.</li>
