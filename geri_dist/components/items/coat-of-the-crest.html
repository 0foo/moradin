Its shimmering lining hints at its magical properties. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this coat, which can be worn over light armor.", 'Additionally, the coat has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you are the target of an attack while wearing this coat, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to gain resistance to one type of damage from the triggering attack. This resistance is effective against the triggering attack and lasts until the start of your next turn.']</td>
