            <li>The Codicil of White is a tall, thin volume bound in white ermine fur over seasoned boards of white pine and sealed with a clasp and lock of tarnished silver. The book is cold to the touch, and the fur is worn about the edges from use. The twenty-seven pages within are of vellum painted with silver gilt on the outer edges. The whole is sewn to a leather binding with strips of sinews, making it quite durable.</li>
            <li>A creature with the codicil in its possession has resistance to cold damage.</li>
            <li>The codicil was written by followers of Auril as a primer on her worship. The first page is a title page with the snowflake symbol of Auril on it. The remaining pages describe various priestly rituals and ceremonies in chilling detail. Nestled among these descriptions is a spell that wizards can learn ({@spell frost fingers|IDRotF}), and a poem called "Rime of the Frostmaiden" (see appendix E). The poem is an incantation, the power of which can be used to split a glacier (see chapter 6). The poem might have other capabilities, at your discretion</li>
