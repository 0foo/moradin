            <li>This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the {@spell scrying} spell. When you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to create a <a href="/components/items/potion-of-greater-healing.html">potion of greater healing</a>. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.</li>
            <li>As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.</li>
            <li>If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by {@spell raise dead} at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.</li>
