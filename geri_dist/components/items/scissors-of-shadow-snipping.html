Whether or not the shadow is snipped, this property of the scissors can't be used again until the next dawn.", 'The detached shadow is rooted to the spot where it was snipped until you use a bonus action to cause it to behave in one of the following ways, either of which is possible only if you can see the shadow:', {'type': 'list', 'items': ["You control the shadow's movements and can make the shadow move up to 30 feet across a solid or liquid surface, in any direction you choose (including along vertical surfaces), provided it remains within your sight at all times.
