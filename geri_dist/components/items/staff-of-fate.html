The recipient can roll this {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, damage roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn. If this extra die is not used before then, it is lost.</li>
                        <li>If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a roll of 9 or lower, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff that breaks the first time it scores a hit and deals damage. On a roll of 10 or higher, the staff regains {@dice 1d6} of its expended charges.</li>
