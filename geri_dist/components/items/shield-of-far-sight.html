The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the {@creature mind flayer} can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the {@creature mind flayer} can see through the shield's eye, which has {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the {@creature mind flayer} can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.", 'If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the {@creature mind flayer} that created it is {@condition blinded} for 2d12 hours.']</td>
