The {@creature water weird} acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.', 'You can command the {@creature water weird} telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the {@creature water weird} to retract into it or if the {@creature water weird} is dead.', 'If the {@creature water weird} is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new {@creature water weird} forms inside it.', 'The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the {@creature water weird} contained within it.']</td>
