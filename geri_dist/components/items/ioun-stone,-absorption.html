            <li>An {@italic Ioun stone} is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of {@italic Ioun stone} exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.</li>
            <li>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of {@dice 1d3} feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</li>
            <li>A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.</li>
            <li>While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.</li>
            <li>Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.</li>
