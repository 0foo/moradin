The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and {@sense darkvision} with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes {@damage 3d10} psychic damage and is {@condition blinded} for 24 hours.', "A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while {@condition blinded}. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over."]</td>
