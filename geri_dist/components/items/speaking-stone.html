If you're a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the {@spell sending} spell from it. The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.", 'In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients.']</td>
