While you bear the charm, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the {@spell speak with plants} spell. For the duration of the spell, you also have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence the behavior, demeanor, and attitude of plants. The charm regains all expended charges at dawn each day.']</td>
