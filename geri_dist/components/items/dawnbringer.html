The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.", "While holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast {@spell lesser restoration} on that creature.

Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while attuned to it.']}, {'name': 'Personality', 'type': 'entries', 'entries': ['Forged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness.

It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.']}]</td>
