The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.", 'Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}.']</td>
