It speaks and reads Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Loross (the dead language of the Empire of Netheril). Professor Skant is a chatterbox and assumes all humanoids are dunderheads.

Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.', "Professor Skant can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.", 'In addition to the knowledge it possesses, Professor Skant can cast the {@spell mage hand} cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.']</td>
