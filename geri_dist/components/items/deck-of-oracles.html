            <li>The illustrations on this deck of oracle cards move or change subtly when viewed indirectly. When you finish a long rest, you can spend 10 minutes consulting the cards for an omen of the coming day. Roll a {@dice d20} and record the number rolled. Once in the next 8 hours, immediately after a creature within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to discard the {@dice d20} roll; the creature must use the number you rolled in place of its roll.</li>
            <li>Additionally, while holding the cards, you can cast {@spell Divination} from them. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
