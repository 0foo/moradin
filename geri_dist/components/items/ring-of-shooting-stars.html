            <li>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast {@spell dancing lights} and {@spell light} from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.</li>
            <li>The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn.</li>

            <ul>
                        <li>You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.</li>
                        <li>Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.</li>
                        <li>As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created. (4 spheres = {@dice 2d4}, 3 spheres = {@dice 2d6}, 2 spheres = {@dice 5d4}, 1 sphere = {@dice 4d12})</li>

            <ul>
                        <li>You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 5d4} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
