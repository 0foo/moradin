            <li>You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can't be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}.

            <li>When you would take damage of the type dealt by the breath of the dragon in whose hoard the ornament became Wakened, you can use your reaction to take no damage instead, and you regain hit points equal to the damage you would have taken.

            <li>While you are wearing the ornament, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. While you are flying using this speed, spectral dragon wings appear on your back.</li>
