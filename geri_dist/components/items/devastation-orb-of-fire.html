            <li>A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a <a href="/components/items/devastation-orb-of-air.html">devastation orb of air</a>. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</li>
            <li>A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates {@dice 1d100} hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as {@spell identify} and {@spell divination} can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</li>
            <li>A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a <a href="/components/items/devastation-orb-of-air.html">devastation orb of air</a> and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes {@dice 1d6} rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.</li>
            <li>Fire Orb</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for {@hazard extreme heat} apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes {@damage 3d6} fire damage.</li>
