The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</li>

            <li>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</li>
            <li>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</li>
