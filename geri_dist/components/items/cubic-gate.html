            <li>You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the {@spell gate} spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the {@spell plane shift} spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.</li>
            <li>The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn.</li>
