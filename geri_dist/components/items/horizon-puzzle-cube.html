A functioning puzzle cube can be solved with 30 minutes of work and a successful DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. When the cube is solved, a 30-foot-diameter portal appears before the creature who solved the cube, leading to the northeastern platform of Horizon's Edge. The portal is two-way and remains open for 10 minutes or until a creature uses an action to change the puzzle's configuration. Puzzle cubes don't function while on Horizon's Edge, but a device somewhere in the demiplane allows a cube to function in reverse while the cube is fitted into it."]</td>
