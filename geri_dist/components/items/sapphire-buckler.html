While wielding the shield, you have resistance to psychic and thunder damage. Also, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal {@damage 2d6} thunder damage to that creature.", "As an action, you can use the shield to help you locate Aberrations until the end of your next turn. If any Aberrations are within 1 mile of you, the shield emits a low humming tone for a moment, and you know the direction of all Aberrations within that range. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."]</td>
