            <li>This shield is made from the scale of an ancient white dragon. It has a rune burned into its outward-facing side. A character who examines the rune and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check recognizes it as an uven ("enemy" in Giant) rune that confers great power.</li>
            <li>While holding the shield, you benefit from the following properties.</li>
            <li>Winter's Friend</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>You are immune to cold damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                        <li>Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal {@damage 3d6} necrotic damage to that creature.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bane</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>You can cast the {@spell bane} spell from the shield (save DC 17). The spell does not require {@status concentration} and lasts for 1 minute. Once you cast the spell from the shield, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Gift of Vengeance</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>You can transfer the shield's magic to a nonmagical weapon by tracing the uven rune on the weapon with one finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shield is destroyed, and the rune is etched or burned into the chosen weapon. This weapon becomes a rare magic item that requires attunement. It has the properties of a +1 weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when the weapon is used against one of the following creature types, chosen by you at the time of the magic weapon's creation: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, or undead.</li>
