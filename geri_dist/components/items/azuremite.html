Curious explorers who discovered the veins found that, when mined and refined into a fine dust, the <a href="/components/items/azuremite.html">azuremite</a> powder is a strong mind-altering agent and induces temporary visions and other psychic phenomena.', 'While a number of small, isolated entrances to this labyrinth of tunnels have been discovered and adventuring parties have attempted to chart the mines, the caverns are so vast and deep that either they gave up for fear of becoming lost, or they were assailed by the terrible denizens of the caverns, never to return.
