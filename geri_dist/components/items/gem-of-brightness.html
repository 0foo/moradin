      "The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn\u0027t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.",

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
