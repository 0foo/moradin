                        <li>The bracelet has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:</li>
                        <ul>
                                <li>1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property</li>
                                <li>1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property</li>
                                <li>1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property</li>
                        </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Dexterous Fingers</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>While wearing the bracelet, you can cast {@spell mage hand}.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Force Sculpture</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>By focusing and channeling the bracelet's magic for 1 minute, you can create a spectral copy of a Large or smaller nonmagical object. The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.</li>
                        <li>The copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a {@spell disintegrate} spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.</li>
                        <li>The bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Helpful Hand</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>As an action, you can use the bracelet to cast {@spell Bigby's hand} as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require {@status concentration}. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
