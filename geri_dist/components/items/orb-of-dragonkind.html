When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.', 'As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.', 'Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.', 'An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.', "While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become {@condition charmed} by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.", "While you are {@condition charmed} by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts {@spell suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis ({@creature Tiamat|RoT|Tiamat's} name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.", {'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Random Properties', 'entries': ['An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:', {'type': 'list', 'items': ['2 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial properties}', '1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental property}', '1 {@table Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental property}']}]}, {'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Spells', 'entries': ['The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can also use an action to cast the {@spell detect magic} spell from the orb without using any charges.']}, {'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Call Dragons', 'entries': ["While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles.
