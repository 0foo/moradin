            <li>A keystone of creation is a piece of the <a href="/components/items/stone-of-creation.html">Stone of Creation</a>, usually between 6 to 10 inches on a side, and can be rough-hewn or cleanly cut and polished by a mason attuned to the <a href="/components/items/stone-of-creation.html">Stone of Creation</a>.</li>
            <li>Random Properties</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>A keystone of creation has the following random properties:</li>
                        <ul>
                                <li>1 {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property</li>
                                <li>1 {@table Beneficial Manifestations|AitFR-AVT|beneficial} manifestation</li>
                                <li>1 {@table Detrimental Manifestations|AitFR-AVT|detrimental} manifestation</li>
                        </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Extradimensional Places</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>You can use the keystone to conjure an extradimensional space such as {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}. The easiest way is to simply cast the spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see "Construction Details."</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Raising Structures</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>You can use the keystone to conjure a physical structure on the Material Plane. The easiest way is to simply cast the {@spell mighty fortress|XGE} spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see "Construction Details." Locations conjured by keystones cannot become permanent through repeated spell castings.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Connected Spaces</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>You can use multiple keystones to create larger spaces, whether adjacent to each other or even interlinked. You can even combine structures on the Material Plane and extradimensional spaces this way. If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Destroying a Keystone</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>A keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a {@spell disintegrate} spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone.</li>
                        <li>After it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over {@dice 1d12 + 1} days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over {@dice 1d20 + 10} minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses.</li>
                        <li>When a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the <a href="/components/items/stone-of-creation.html">Stone of Creation</a> is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing.</li>
                        <li>If it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the {@spell plane shift} spell), a keystone is destroyed.</li>
