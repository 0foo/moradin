                                <li>When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an artificial gravity field while the ship is in the void of space, so that creatures can walk on the ship's decks as they normally would.

                                <li>Whenever you like, you can see what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.</li>
