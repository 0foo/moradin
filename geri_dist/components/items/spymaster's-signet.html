                        <li>As an action, you may present a Seal of Drakkenheim to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each {@creature wall gargoyle|DoDk} or {@creature tower dragon|DoDk} that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions.
