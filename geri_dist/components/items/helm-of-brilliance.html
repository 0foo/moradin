The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.",

The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d6} fire damage.
