            <li>Unlike most scrolls, a Nether Scroll of Azumar is not a consumable magic item. It takes 30 days of concentrated study—at least 8 hours per day—to attempt to understand this scroll. After completing this study, you must make a DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. If this check fails, you take {@damage 16d10} psychic damage, and you can attempt the check again after another 30 days of concentrated study.</li>
            <li>When you succeed on the check, you gain the following benefits:</li>

            <li>When you gain the scroll's benefits, a {@creature stone golem} magically appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you and acts as your ally. If you die, the golem turns to dust.</li>
