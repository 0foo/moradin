            <li>This swift vessel is a relatively recent design, quickly gaining popularity with merchants and pirates. A shrike ship's legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but isn't built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.</li>
            <li>Standard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistaeâ€”one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship's reinforced bow can be used as a piercing ram.</li>
