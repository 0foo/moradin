            <li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger, the creature's soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a {@spell wish} spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.</li>
            <li>For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra {@damage 1d4} necrotic damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.</li>
            <li>The dagger has the following additional properties.</li>
            <li>Siphon Vitality</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain {@dice 1d10} hit points per soul released.</li>

            <li>Annihilation</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. If the target dies, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.</li>
