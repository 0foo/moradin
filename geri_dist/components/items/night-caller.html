If a character succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill History}) check, the character recalls lore that says the {@creature duergar} made several such whistles for various groups in an age past.', "If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky, it allows you to cast the {@spell animate dead} spell. The target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth or similar material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw its way to the surface to serve you. Once the whistle has animated an undead creature, it can't do so again until 7 days have passed.", 'Once every 24 hours, you can blow the whistle to reassert control over one or two creatures you animated with it.']</td>
