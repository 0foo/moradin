The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.", "The spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. The spirit obeys your commands (no action required by you); if you don't issue any commands, the spirit takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its movement to avoid danger.", "Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.", 'Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.']</td>
