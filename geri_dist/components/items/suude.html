It was first developed by power-hungry archmages in the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum} as an incense burned to enhance focus during ritual spellcasting. The secret to its refinement has been lost and rediscovered a variety of times since the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, and many different types of {@item suude|TDCSR} have been developed by arcanists in search of ever-greater power. It has terrible addictive and mentally degenerative properties, even when used sparingly.", 'After burning {@item suude|TDCSR} within a vessel and inhaling its fumes as an action, you take 22 ({@damage 4d10}) psychic damage and must make a {@dc 10} Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}. On a failure, you become {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour and fall {@condition unconscious} for 1 minute, or until you are shaken awake as an action. During this time, the world seems to move in slow motion, and your vision is twisted in kaleidoscopic colorsâ€”yet your focus is never distorted. If one dose of {@item suude|TDCSR}, or more, is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} is increased by 5 per additional dose. If you fail this save by 10 or more, you instantly drop to 0 hit points.', "On a success, you gain the ability to use one of the following Metamagic options as a sorcerer for the next minute, requiring no sorcery points. The type of Metamagic you gain access to depends on the type of {@item suude|TDCSR}, and once you use it, you can't use it again until you inhale {@item suude|TDCSR} again.", '{@item Suude (Brown)|TDCSR|Brown suude} allows you to use the {@optfeature Extended Spell|PHB} Metamagic option, {@item Suude (blue)|TDCSR|blue suude} allows you to use {@optfeature Twinned Spell|PHB}, and {@item Suude (Brown)|TDCSR|red suude} grants {@optfeature Distant Spell|PHB}.']</td>
