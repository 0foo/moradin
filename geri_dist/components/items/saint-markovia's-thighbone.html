She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.', 'Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a {@creature vampire} did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of {@creature vampire spawn} to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one.', 'Suffused with confidence born of a righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet.', "The essence of Markovia's saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead.", '{@item Mace of Disruption}. When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra {@damage 2d6} radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes {@condition frightened} of you until the end of your next turn.', 'While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.']</td>
