When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an extra {@damage 5d4} damage of your choice of one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.', "While holding the flail, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause the heads to breathe multicolored flames in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 14d6} damage of one of the following damage types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."]</td>
