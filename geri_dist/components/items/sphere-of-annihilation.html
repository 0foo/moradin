            <li>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception.

            <li>The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking {@damage 4d10} force damage.</li>
            <li>If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.</li>
