            <li>While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular {@creature djinni} from the Elemental Plane of Air. The {@creature djinni} appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.</li>
            <li>While summoned, the {@creature djinni} is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the {@creature djinni} defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.</li>
            <li>After the {@creature djinni} departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the {@creature djinni} dies.</li>
