            <li>This scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.</li>
            <li>As an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:</li>
            <li>Breath of Life</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>The scale disappears, and you or a creature you touch regains {@dice 10d4} hit points.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Platinum Shield</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a <a href="/components/items/+1-shield.html">+1 shield</a>, which you or another creature can use. A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Radiant Hammer</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic <a href="/components/items/light-hammer.html">light hammer</a>, which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals {@damage 2d4} radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra {@damage 2d4} radiant damage to chromatic dragons.</li>
                        <li>Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back. If you pull off a scale but don't speak a command word, it disappears after 1 minute.</li>
