            <li>You gain the ability to channel energy from allies to cast spells, even if you normally can't. When an ally within 60 feet of you casts a spell that you normally can't cast and that requires 10 gp or fewer in material components, you may use a reaction to cast that spell. When cast in this way, the spell is cast using your ally's spellcasting ability, spell save DC, and spell attack bonus, as needed. You decide this cloned spell's target, as specified in the spell's description, and the spell originates from you. After you use this ability, your ally can't cast this spell again until they finish a long rest.</li>
