            <li>Crafted by the {@creature drow}, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting modifier) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is {@condition restrained} for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.</li>
            <li>Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the {@condition restrained} creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of <a href="/components/items/oil-of-etherealness.html">oil of etherealness</a> or <a href="/components/items/universal-solvent.html">universal solvent</a>. The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.</li>
            <li>The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wands last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.</li>
            <li>A wand of viscous globs is destroyed if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.</li>
