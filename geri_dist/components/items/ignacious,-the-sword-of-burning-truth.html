            <li>This sacred weapon was forged to burn away deception and darkness. Blazing embers gently fall from the silver blade, first ignited by the brazier in the Temple of Lumen.</li>
            <li>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:</li>
            <li>You can use a bonus action to speak the sword's name, causing radiant flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} in a 40-foot radius and {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra {@damage 4d6} radiant damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to douse the blade, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.</li>

                        <li>Ignacious is a sentient lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 19, and a Charisma of 23. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, Celestial, and Draconic, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. It always knows its wielder's thoughts. Its voice is commanding, righteous, and booming. When drawn, Ignacious casts the {@spell zone of truth} spell (save DC 20), and maintains {@status concentration} on it so that you don't have to. The {@spell zone of truth} moves with the blade and remains centred on it.</li>

                        <li>The sword's purpose is to expose all deception and reveal the truth. It does not tolerate any falsehood, duplicitousness, or lies. The sword always knows when it hears a lie, and responds with wrathful fury. If a wielder speaks a lie, it immediately triggers a conflict.</li>

The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.</li>
                        <li>A character attuned to three Relics of Saint Vitruvio may cast the {@spell heal} spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again.
