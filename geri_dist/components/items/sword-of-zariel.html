            <li>This longsword belonged to the angel Zariel before her fall from grace. Fashioned from celestial steel, it gives off a faint glow and hum. The weapon chooses who can attune to it and who can't. It desires a wielder who embodies bravery and heroism.</li>

            <ul>
                        <li>The sword allows you to attune to it immediately, without having to take a short rest. The first time you attune to the sword, you are transformed into a heavenly, idealized version of yourself, blessed with otherworldly beauty and a touch of heaven in your heart. Neither magic nor divine intervention can reverse this transformation. Your alignment becomes lawful good, and you gain the following traits:</li>

                        <li>As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword's light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.</li>

                        <li>The sword deals an extra 9 ({@damage 2d8}) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 ({@damage 3d10}) radiant damage if you're wielding the weapon with two hands.

            <li>Sentience</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>The Sword of Zariel is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.</li>
                        <li>The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.</li>

            <li>Destroying the Sword</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see "{@adventure Shattering the Companion|bgdia|8|shattering the companion}"), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.</li>
                        <li>If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword.</li>
            </ul>
