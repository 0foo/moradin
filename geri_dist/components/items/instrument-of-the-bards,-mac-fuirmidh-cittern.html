            <li>An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way.

            <li>You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.</li>
