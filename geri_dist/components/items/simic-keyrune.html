It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger.', "At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it.
