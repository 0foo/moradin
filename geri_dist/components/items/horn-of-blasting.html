            <li>You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 5d6} thunder damage and is {@condition deafened} for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition deafened}. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take {@damage 10d6} thunder damage instead of {@dice 5d6}.</li>
