            <li>This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the {@spell detect evil and good} spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.</li>

            <li>The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.</li>
            <li>While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the {@spell gate} spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.</li>
