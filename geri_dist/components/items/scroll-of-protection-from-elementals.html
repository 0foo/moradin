For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents elementals from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that an elemental would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier.']</td>
