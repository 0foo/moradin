Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. While it is {@condition frightened} in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action it can use only the {@action Dash} action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the {@action Dodge} action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.", 'The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.']</td>
