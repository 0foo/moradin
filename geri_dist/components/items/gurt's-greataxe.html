Gurt's greataxe was buried in Morgur's Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city's vaults for decades, the axe was given to Harshnag, a {@creature frost giant} adventurer, in recognition of his service to Waterdeep. Uthgardt barbarians recognize the weapon on sight and attack any giant that wields it.", 'You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals {@damage 3d12} slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra {@damage 2d12} slashing damage if the target is human.', "The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The light can't be shut off in these conditions.", "As an action, you can cast a version of the {@spell heat metal} spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."]</td>
