                                <li>You have {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have {@sense darkvision}, being attuned to the rapier increases the range of your {@sense darkvision} by 60 feet.</li>
                                <li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
                                <li>You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also {@condition unconscious} while {@condition poisoned} in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the creature awake.</li>
                                <li>While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.</li>

                        <li>The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property and one {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property and an additional {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property.
