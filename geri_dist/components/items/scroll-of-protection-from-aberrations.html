            <li>Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in an {@condition invisible} barrier that extends from you to form a 5-foot-radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents aberrations from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that an aberration would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier.</li>
