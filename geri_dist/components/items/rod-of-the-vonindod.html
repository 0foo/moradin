            <li>The {@creature fire giant} Duke Zalto hired a wizard to craft several of these adamantine rods. Each measures 4 feet long, weighs 100 pounds, and is sized to fit comfortably in a {@creature fire giant||fire giant's} hand. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.</li>
            <li>The rod has 10 charges and regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the {@spell locate object} spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.</li>
