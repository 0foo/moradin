            <li>This weapon is a long metal lance with a small flame that burns at its end. It has a hose coming from the hilt that connects to a metal tank that you wear on your back.</li>
            <li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</li>
            <li>The tank has 5 charges. You can use an action and expend one or more charges from the tank to cast {@spell burning hands} (Save DC 15). For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.</li>
            <li>Once per day, you can pour a vial of alchemist's fire into the tank. When you do, it regains all expended charges. It otherwise does not regain charges on its own.</li>
            <li>You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.</li>
