            <li>This bright plume is made from the feather of a {@creature diatryma|wdh} (pronounced dee-ah-TRY-mah), a Large, colorful, flightless bird native to the Underdark. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the feather into a Large unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you, the feather becomes a living diatryma for up to 6 hours, after which it reverts to its feather form. It reverts to feather form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching the bird.</li>
            <li>When the diatryma reverts to feather form, the magic of the feather can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</li>
            <li>The diatryma uses the statistics of an {@creature axe beak}, except that its beak deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it can be used as a mount. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the diatryma defends itself but takes no other actions.</li>
