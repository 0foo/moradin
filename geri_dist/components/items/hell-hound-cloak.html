            <li>This dark cloak is made of cured {@creature hell hound} hide. As an action, you can command the cloak to transform you into a {@creature hell hound} for up to 1 hour. The transformation otherwise functions as the {@spell polymorph} spell, but you can use a bonus action to revert to your normal form.</li>
            <li>Curse</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>This cloak is cursed with the essence of a {@creature hell hound}, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with {@spell remove curse} or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it within reach at all times.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The sixth time you use the cloak, and each time thereafter, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the transformation lasts until dispelled or until you drop to 0 hit points, and you can't willingly return to normal form. If you ever remain in {@creature hell hound} form for 6 hours, the transformation becomes permanent and you lose your sense of self. All your statistics are then replaced by those of a {@creature hell hound}. Thereafter, only {@spell remove curse} or similar magic allows you to regain your identity and return to normal. If you remain in this permanent form for 6 days, only a {@spell wish} spell can reverse the transformation.</li>
