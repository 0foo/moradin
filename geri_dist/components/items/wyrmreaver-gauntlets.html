            <li>While you are wearing these gauntlets, your unarmed strike deals an additional {@damage 1d6} force damage on a hit.

            <ul>
                        <li>As a bonus action, you can invoke the gauntlets' runes and summon two enormous spectral fists that envelop the gauntlets and mimic your hand motions. The fists can also launch themselves to strike distant opponents, returning immediately to your space after they hit or miss.</li>
                        <li>The fists last for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. While the spectral fists are active, unarmed strikes you make on your turn have a reach of 30 feet, and when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack made with your unarmed strike, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or have the prone condition.</li>
