Some alchemists in {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} have discovered that dissolving whitestone with specific acids can leave behind pure <a href="/components/items/residuum.html">residuum</a>, which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.']</td>
