You know where to go in the Lower City and Outer City for anonymity. In these slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree of privacy and no questions asked.

In this solitary work, you've learned secrets no one else knows."], ['5', "You killed a patriar's scion in an illegal duel.
