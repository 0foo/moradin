                    <li>The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.</li>

                    <li>At 2nd level, your mind awakens to the ability to communicate via telepathy. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you in this manner. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.</li>

                    <li>Even the simplest psionic technique requires a deep understanding of how psionic energy can augment mind and body. This understanding allows you to alter your defenses to better deal with threats.</li>
                    <li>Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.</li>

                    <li>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with psychic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra {@damage 1d8} psychic damage to that target. When you reach 14th level, this extra damage increases to 2d8.</li>
                    <li>In addition, you add your Intelligence modifier to any damage roll you make for a {@filter psionic talent|psionics|type=T}.</li>

                <p>Name: Consumptive Power</p>
                <ul>
                <li>level: 10</li>
                    <li>At 10th level, you gain the ability to sacrifice your physical durability in exchange for psionic power. When activating a psionic discipline, you can pay its psi point cost with your hit points, instead of using any psi points. Your current hit points and hit point maximum are both reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This reduction can't be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest.</li>
                    <li>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                <li>level: 11</li>
                    <li>Beginning at 11th level, your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines. You can't also spend your normal psi points on these disciplines; you can spend only the special points gained from this feature. When you finish a long rest, you lose any of these special points that you haven't spent.</li>
                    <li>If more than one of the disciplines you activate with these points require {@status concentration}, you can concentrate on all of them. Activating one of them ends any effect you were already {@status concentration||concentrating} on, and if you begin {@status concentration||concentrating} on an effect that doesn't use these special points, the disciplines end that you're {@status concentration||concentrating} on.</li>
                    <li>At 15th level, the pool of psi points you gain from this feature increases to 11.</li>
                    <li>You have one use of this feature, and you regain any expended use of it with a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th, 15th, and 17th level.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Name: Psionic Mastery (2/Day)</p>

                <li>level: 14</li>
                    <li>At 14th level, you gain another feature from your Mystic Order.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Name: Psionic Mastery (3/Day)</p>
                <ul>
                <li>level: 15</li>
                    <li>At 15th level, you can use your Psionic Mastery three times per day.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Name: Psionic Mastery (4/Day)</p>
                <ul>
                <li>level: 17</li>
                    <li>At 17th level, you can use your Psionic Mastery four times per day.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Name: Psionic Body</p>
                <ul>
                <li>level: 20</li>
                    <li>At 20th level, your mastery of psionic power causes your mind to transcend the body. Your physical form is infused with psionic energy. You gain the following benefits:</li>
                    <li>{'type': 'list', 'items': ['You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.', 'You no longer age.', 'You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the {@condition poisoned} condition.', 'If you die, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you discorporate with 0 hit points, instead of dying, and you fall {@condition unconscious}. You and your gear disappear. You appear at a spot of your choice 1d3 days later on the plane of existence where you died, having gained the benefits of one long rest.']}</li>
