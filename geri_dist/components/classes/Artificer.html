                <ul>
                <li>level: 1</li>
                    <li>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have <a href="/components/items/thieves'-tools.html">thieves' tools</a> or <a href="/components/items/artisan's-tools.html">artisan's tools</a> in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</li>
                    <li>{'type': 'list', 'items': ['The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.', 'Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.', 'The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.', "A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like."]}</li>
                    <li>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</li>
                    <li>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Name: Optional Rule: Firearm Proficiency</p>
                <ul>
                <li>level: 1</li>
                    <li>The secrets of creating and operating gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in {@book chapter 9|DMG|9|Firearms} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                <li>level: 1</li>
                    <li>You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</li>
                    <li>{'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Tools Required', 'entries': ['You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically <a href="/components/items/thieves\'-tools.html">thieves\' tools</a> or some kind of <a href="/components/items/artisan\'s-tools.html">artisan\'s tools</a>—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an \'M\' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See {@book chapter 5|PHB|4}, "Equipment," in the {@book Player\'s Handbook|PHB} for descriptions of these tools.', 'After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.', {'type': 'inset', 'name': 'The Magic of Artifice', 'entries': ["As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast {@spell cure wounds} using <a href="/components/items/alchemist's-supplies.html">alchemist's supplies</a>, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using <a href="/components/items/tinker's-tools.html">tinker's tools</a>, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast {@spell poison spray}, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.", "The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace {@spell cure wounds} with {@spell heat metal}, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.", "Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters."]}]}</li>
                    <li>{'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Cantrips (0-Level Spells)', 'entries': ['At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the {@filter artificer spell list|spells|level=0|class=Artificer}.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.", 'You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the {@filter artificer spell list|spells|class=Artificer}. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.', "For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@spell cure wounds}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.", 'You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.']}</li>

To many, artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.', 'The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.', "Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.", "Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once."]}</li>

An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion\'s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see "Attunement" in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master\'s Guide|DMG}).', 'Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.', 'You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time.

                    <li>While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier.
