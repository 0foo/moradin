With one hour of work using a <a href="/components/items/poisoner's-kit.html">poisoner's kit</a> and expending 50 gp worth of materials, you can create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 2d8} poison damage and become {@condition poisoned} until the end of your next turn."]}]<br/>
