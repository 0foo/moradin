An as action, a creature can throw a tangler grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 10 feet of a shattered tangler grenade must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be <a href="/compiled_data/conditions/condition-list.html">restrained</a> by sticky white webs. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or another creature within its reach from the webs, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (<a href="/compiled_data/skills/skills.html">Athletics</a>) check. A gallon of alcohol dissolves the webs produced by a single tangler grenade. Otherwise, the webs dissolve on their own after 1 hour, freeing any creatures <a href="/compiled_data/conditions/condition-list.html">restrained</a> by them.']</td>
