While wearing a fargab, you can use an action to speak into the device's mouthpiece and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to another creature wearing the matched fargab while it is within 18 miles of you. The message emits from the speakers of the device and can be heard up to 10 feet away from the device. If no creature is wearing the fargab, the speakers make static noises instead."]</td>
