It was originally a ritualistic tool used by the followers of many gods, but now sees more recreational use. Oracles used it to enhance their divinations, for it helped them leave their physical bodies behind and become closer to gods and spirits. Drinking tea brewed from the root causes intense hallucinations, which feel like they have granted perfect clarity of mind to the imbiber.', 'After drinking <a href="/compiled_data/items/oloore-root-teabag.html">Oloore Root Teabag</a> as an action, you must succeed on a {@dc 19} Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} or experience vivid hallucinations for 1d4 hours. During this time, you have {@quickref Advantage and Disadvantage|PHB|2|0|disadvantage} on attack rolls and {@quickref ability checks|PHB|2|0}. If you fail the {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} by 10 or more, your hallucinations become horrific visions and you gain a level of <a href="/compiled_data/conditions/condition-list.html">exhaustion</a>. On a success, you gain preternatural clarity, allowing you to cast the {@spell scrying} spell once within the next 1d4 hours.']</td>
