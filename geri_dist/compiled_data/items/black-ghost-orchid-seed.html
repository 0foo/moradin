A creature that consumes one of these black seeds is affected by the spell {@spell feign death}. If the creature is unaware of the pod's effects or does not wish to be affected, it can resist the effect by succeeding on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Otherwise, it is considered to be a willing recipient of the spell."]</td>
