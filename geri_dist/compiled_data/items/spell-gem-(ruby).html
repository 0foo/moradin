Doing so doesn't require any components, and doesn't require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.", "If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

Spells cast from the spell gem have a save DC of 18 and an attack bonus of {@hit 10}.', "You can imbue the gem with a spell if you're attuned to it and it's empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell's level must be no higher than the gem's maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed, you must provide them, but they can be worth half as much as normal.", "Once imbued with a spell, the gem can't be imbued again until the next dawn.", 'Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.']</td>
