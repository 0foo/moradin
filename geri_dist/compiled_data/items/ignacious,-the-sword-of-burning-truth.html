It always knows its wielder's thoughts. Its voice is commanding, righteous, and booming.

It does not tolerate any falsehood, duplicitousness, or lies. The sword always knows when it hears a lie, and responds with wrathful fury. If a wielder speaks a lie, it immediately triggers a conflict."]}, {'type': 'entries', 'name': 'Relics of Saint Vitruvio', 'entries': ['These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim.
