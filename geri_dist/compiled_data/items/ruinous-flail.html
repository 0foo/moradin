On a failed save, the creature has the poisoned condition for 1 minute. The poisoned creature takes {@damage 2d4} necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this property is used in this way, it can't be used again until the next dawn."]</td>
