As an action, you can activate the vial to target a creature you can see within 10 feet of you to learn its surface thoughts and pull the thoughts learned out of the creature's head as a tangible glowing string of energy known as a thought strand. The strands can be stored in the vial for up to 24 hours or until the vial reaches capacity, in which case the oldest strands dissipate. A creature affected by the vial knows that its thoughts are being probed.", 'The vial can also store thought strands created by the {@spell encode thoughts|ggr} cantrip. It does not extend the duration of those strands beyond 8 hours, but stored strands do not disappear if you cast {@spell encode thoughts|ggr} again during the duration of the cantrip.', 'The vial has 3 charges and can store up to 3 thought strands. It regains all its charges daily at dusk.']</td>
