As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell dominate monster} (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that's not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended.", "If you are not a devil, using the helm's {@spell dominate monster} property in the Nine Hells has a {@chance 20|20 percent} chance of attracting a {@creature narzugon|MTF}, which arrives on the back of a {@creature nightmare} mount in 1d4 hours. The narzugon tries to recover the helm, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the helm, the narzugon tries to deliver it to its infernal master."]</td>
