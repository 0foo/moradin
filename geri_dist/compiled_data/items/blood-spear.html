In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.', 'When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.', 'Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character {@adventure chosen by Kavan|CoS|14|Blood Spear of Kavan} to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.']</td>
