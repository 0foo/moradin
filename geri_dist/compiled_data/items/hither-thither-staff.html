This staff has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.', 'As an action, you can expend 1 charge from the staff to create two linked teleportation portals, each one appearing on a flat surface of your choice that you can see within 1,500 feet of yourself. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as an action to relocate one or both portals, subject to the same limitation. The surface on which a portal appears must be big enough to accommodate it. Each portal is a two-dimensional, glowing oval ring, and together they create an open doorway up to 6 feet high and 4 feet wide. Any creature or object entering one portal exits from the other as if the two portals were a single opening that connects their locations.', "A portal can appear on a moving surface, but the effect ends when the two portals move more than 1 mile apart. As a bonus action while holding the staff, you can close both portals (ending the effect) or suppress one portal, causing it to disappear until you relocate it (see above), during which time the remaining portal can't be used. The portals otherwise last for 24 hours."]</td>
