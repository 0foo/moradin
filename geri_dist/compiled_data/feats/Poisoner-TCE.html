Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 2d8} poison damage and become <a href="/compiled_data/conditions/condition-list.html">poisoned</a> until the end of your next turn."]}]<br/>
