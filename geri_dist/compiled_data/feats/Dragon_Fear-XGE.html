A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes <a href="/compiled_data/conditions/condition-list.html">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute. If the <a href="/compiled_data/conditions/condition-list.html">frightened</a> target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."]}]<br/>
