When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.

However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as {@sense darkvision}, unless your new form also has that sense.", "You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form."]}</li>
