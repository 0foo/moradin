  <li>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See {@book chapter 10|phb|10|casting a spell} for the rules on spellcasting.</li>

  <li>Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.</li>
  <li>If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (<a href="/compiled_data/skills/skills.html">Arcana</a>) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.</li>
  <li>This Intelligence (<a href="/compiled_data/skills/skills.html">Arcana</a>) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.</li>

  <li>This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.</li>
  <li>When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the <a href="/compiled_data/conditions/condition-list.html">incapacitated</a> condition or the {@spell shocking grasp} spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.</li>

  <li>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.</li>
  <li>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.</li>
  <li>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the <a href="/compiled_data/actions/actions.html">Disengage</a> action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</li>

  <li>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</li>
  <li>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."</li>
  <li>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</li>
  <li>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires <b>concentration</b> (explained in {@book chapter 10|phb|10|concentration}). If your <b>concentration</b> is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are <b>concentration||concentrating</b> on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your <b>concentration</b> might be broken.</li>
  <li>You have until the start of your next turn to use a readied action.</li>
