As a {@book Myriad|TDCSR|2|The Myriad} operative in Tal'Dorei, you might have been given a specific task that furthers that syndicate's hunger to expand beyond Wildemount, or which gives them an edge in their rivalry with the {@book Clasp|TDCSR|2|The Clasp}. Moreover, you understand the wisdom of keeping your activities secret from fellow criminals as well as law enforcement, since the agents of the {@book Clasp|TDCSR|2|The Clasp} will show you no mercy if your true identity is ever revealed."]}}]}}<br/>
