    "Any humanoid that spends 12 hours in the necropolis must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract an arcane blight. This magical disease transforms the humanoid into a {@creature nothic}, but only after the victim experiences hallucinations and feelings of isolation and paranoia. Other symptoms include clammy skin, hair loss, and myopia (nearsightedness).",
    "A player character infected with the arcane blight gains the following flaw: \"I don't trust anyone.\" This flaw, which supersedes any conflicting flaw, is fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.",
    "Whenever it finishes a long rest, an infected humanoid must repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for future saves against the arcane blight drops by {@dice 1d6}. If the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature overcomes the arcane blight and becomes immune to the effect of further exposure. A creature that fails three of these saving throws transforms into a {@creature nothic} under the DM's control. Only a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.",

The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires {@status concentration}. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.",

If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability\u2014perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature\u2014your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply."

The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it regained."
